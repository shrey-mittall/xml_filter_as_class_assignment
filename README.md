# xml_fiter_as_class_assignment
This is a very simple program that creates a text file from a marked up file. However, it is incomplete. I am using it as an exercise for students to learn git.
If you run this on a copy of the webpage for the fourth homework assignment (assignment4.html), there are at least 2 bugs:
1 related to information contained in <style> </style> markings
1 related to the interpretation of characters represented as &XYZ; where the string between & and ;  indicates a character  â€“ see html and xml character references in the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encodings_in_HTML
You should add code to take care of these cases.  Then you should create your on repository containing an updated clone of this program.  It should be a private repository which you share with the grader.
